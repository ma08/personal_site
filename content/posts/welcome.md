# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my personal website and blog! I'm Sourya Kakarla, an AI/ML researcher and engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

## What to Expect

This blog will serve as a platform for me to share:

- Insights and thoughts on AI, machine learning, and technology trends
- Technical tutorials and how-to guides on topics I'm passionate about
- Updates on my research, projects, and professional journey
- Reflections on the intersection of technology and society

My main focus areas include Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, and Information Security. I believe in the power of AI to transform industries and improve lives, which is what drives my work at Skylink and my research.

## My Background

For those who don't know me, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at Columbia University and have worked on various projects ranging from speech recognition and NLP to cryptography and security. I've published several papers in these areas and have experience working at companies like Microsoft and startups at various stages.

Currently, I'm building AI-driven corporate travel solutions as a Founding ML Engineer at Skylink (Y-Combinator W22), where we're using Large Language Models to transform the business travel experience.
