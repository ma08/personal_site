## Hi, I'm Sourya Kakarla

I'm an AI/ML engineer and founder who loves being at the forefront of applying research for real-world impact. As Co-founder of [Zone](https://trymyzone.com), I'm reimagining operations with **AI Operations Managers** for industrial sectors. Check out our **[Solutions Page](https://solutions.trymyzone.com/)** to see our product offerings.


Life has made me go through quite a number of twists and turns that took me from big tech to dropping out of PhD to finally finding my grove at startups. Designing agent orchestration and eval systems for real world agents that can go beyond cool demos. I have a [research background](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iW7jiUcAAAAJ) in Speech&NLP and InfoSec. Alum of IIT Kharagpur and Columbia University.

After leading the AI/ML team at Skylink (YC W22) where we built a slack agent for [corporate travel bookings for McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/flying-higher-the-ai-upgrade-simplifying-mckinsey-travel), I'm now focused on bringing ambient agentic experience to consumer messaging :)

## Founding Journey

### Zone
Zone is an **AI Operations Manager for the industrial sector**.

We are building Multimodal Ambient Agents for Physical Operations.


#### The Journey
Our path to Zone has been one of discovery:
1.  **The Problem**: We saw how AI assistants failed bilingual, multigenerational families.
2.  **The Experiment**: We built a WhatsApp assistant for our own family.
3.  **The Validation**: Thousands adopted it, proving the need.
4.  **The Foundation**: We built the Zone app, an ambient agent for families.
5.  **The Signal**: B2B interest skyrocketed for our Ambient Agent Architecture.
6.  **The Pivot**: We realized the need for agents beyond the screen - **Physical Intelligence**.

### The Journey from Ladduu AI to Zone

We started with Ladduu AI, focused on helping seniors and their families through:
- Multilingual voice and chat assistants for navigating digital services
- WhatsApp assistant supporting 8+ Indian languages (reached 5,000+ users)
- iOS voice assistant for essential services

Through this journey, we discovered something profound: the real value wasn't just in helping individuals complete tasks, but in enhancing human-to-human communication. This insight led us to pivot to Zone - bringing ambient AI agents to everyone's messaging experience, where tasks are understood and executed automatically while you focus on what matters: connecting with people.

## Work Experience

### Skylink (YC W22)
Joined as Founding ML Engineer and led the ML team at SkyLink. Designed and built agent orchestration and evals systems. 
### Microsoft
Working as Software Engineer in bigtech successfully instilled a deep existential crisis and triggered a depression arch that guided me towards research and startups.


## Research Interests
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI
- Multilingual Natural Language Processing 
- Voice Assistants and Speech Recognition
- Accessibility and Robotics
- Cryptography & Information Security

I [published papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iW7jiUcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in reputable conferences and journals, focusing on applied NLP and cryptanalysis. My work has been recognized with awards such as the Best Paper at ASONAM 2016 Conference.

## Musings

### Reading
I used to hate nonfiction till I was like 20.

#### Fiction
Some of my favourite fiction works:
- ASOIAF
- HHGTG
- Stranger in a Strange land
- Catch 22
- Jeffrey Archer (guilty pleasure while growing up)
- (other cliched stuff)

#### Non-fiction

Then I went into a "seeking" phase where that's all I read for a few years.

Especially existential/spiritual/religious/mythological books to make sense of the universe/myself.

Some authors/genres/fields:
- Herman Hesse
- Richard Dawkins
- Yuval Noah Harari
- Camus
- Buddhism
  - Old Path, White Clouds
  - Two Truths
- Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism)
  - Advaita/Non-duality
  - Shaivism/Shaktism
  - Karma, Bhakti, Gnyana, Raja Yogas

Once I got the startup bug, I read a few of the typical startup books:
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things
- Zero to One
- Outliers

#### Currently Reading
Currently reading [The Infinite Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38390751-the-infinite-game) by Simon Sinek.

#### Recently Completed
- [Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs) by Walter Isaacson
- [Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61392261-elon-musk) by Walter Isaacson

Jotted down some of my reads in [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/181795910-sourya-kakarla). TODO: Update it.

### Music
My music taste has seasons. Some times I listen to eastern devotional songs like:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram
- Aigiri Nandini

In other phases, I listen to western classic/soft rock:
- Pink Floyd
- Led Zeppelin

East-West fusion in content and style is probably my favourite genre. Example:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram by Shanti People

Can't sing for the life of me but write occassionally. Here's a song I wrote in Telugu - [Listen Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjKHg9MKsVm6f_K1Gg07jCecss4b0id7/view?usp=sharing).

### Writing

Scribbling down my thoughts into "poems" is a favourite cathartic pastime.

Holy Nature - My favorite among all my amateur work got featured in [Poets of Columbia](https://issuu.com/poetsofcolumbia/docs/poets_of_columbia_issue_one/12).

### Soccer
- Arsenal fan, 'Gooner/Gunner' for life!
- Receiving Gold Medal through MS Hall in IIT KGP General Championship is a highlight of my soccer life.
- FIFA is pretty much the only video game I ever played consistantly. Always up for a game if time permits.
