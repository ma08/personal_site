## Hi, I'm Sourya Kakarla

 ML researcher turned founder. I love learning the fundamentals and building systems that work in the real world, not just in demos. Delivering the experience of "flow" is what I swim towards.

As Co-founder & CTO of [Zone](https://trymyzone.com), I'm creating **AI Operations Managers**: flexible multimodal ambient agents to monitor meaningful events and optimize physical operations. [See our solutions →](https://solutions.trymyzone.com/)

My path: big tech → PhD dropout → startups. Have been around the agentic block to be able to say I know my orchestration/eval loops. Research background in [Speech, NLP & InfoSec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iW7jiUcAAAAJ). Alum of IIT Kharagpur and Columbia.

Previously led the ML team at Skylink (YC W22), building a Slack agent for [corporate travel that served McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/flying-higher-the-ai-upgrade-simplifying-mckinsey-travel) and 40k+ users.

## Founding Journey

### Zone
**AI Operations Manager for the industrial sector.** Multimodal ambient agents for physical operations.

#### The Journey
1. **The Problem**: AI assistants failed bilingual, multigenerational families.
2. **The Experiment**: Built a WhatsApp assistant for our own family.
3. **The Validation**: Thousands adopted it, proving the need.
4. **The Foundation**: Built the Zone app—an ambient agent for families.
5. **The Signal**: B2B interest skyrocketed for our ambient agent architecture.
6. **The Pivot**: Agents beyond the screen—**Physical Intelligence**.

## Musings

### Reading
I used to hate nonfiction until my early twenties.

#### Fiction
Some of my favourite fiction works:
- ASOIAF
- HHGTG
- Stranger in a Strange land
- Catch 22
- Jeffrey Archer (guilty pleasure while growing up)
- (other cliched stuff)

#### Non-fiction

Then I went into a "seeking" phase where that's all I read for a few years.

Especially existential/spiritual/religious/mythological books to make sense of the universe/myself.

Some authors/genres/fields:
- Herman Hesse
- Richard Dawkins
- Yuval Noah Harari
- Camus
- Buddhism
  - Old Path, White Clouds
  - Two Truths
- Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism)
  - Advaita/Non-duality
  - Shaivism/Shaktism
  - Karma, Bhakti, Gnyana, Raja Yogas

Once I got the startup bug, I read a few of the typical startup books:
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things
- Zero to One
- Outliers

#### Currently Reading
Currently reading [The Infinite Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38390751-the-infinite-game) by Simon Sinek.

#### Recently Completed
- [Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs) by Walter Isaacson
- [Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61392261-elon-musk) by Walter Isaacson
- [The Rule of One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52206867-the-rule-of-one) by Ashley & Leslie Saunders

Some reads logged on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/181795910-sourya-kakarla).

### Music
My music taste has seasons. Some times I listen to eastern devotional songs like:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram
- Aigiri Nandini

In other phases, I listen to western classic/soft rock:
- Pink Floyd
- Led Zeppelin

East-West fusion in content and style is probably my favourite genre. Example:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram by Shanti People

Can't sing for the life of me but write occasionally. Here's a song I wrote in Telugu - [Listen Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjKHg9MKsVm6f_K1Gg07jCecss4b0id7/view?usp=sharing).

### Writing

Scribbling down my thoughts into "poems" is a favourite cathartic pastime.

Holy Nature - My favorite among all my amateur work got featured in [Poets of Columbia](https://issuu.com/poetsofcolumbia/docs/poets_of_columbia_issue_one/12).

### Soccer
- Arsenal fan, 'Gooner/Gunner' for life!
- Receiving Gold Medal through MS Hall in IIT KGP General Championship is a highlight of my soccer life.
- FIFA is pretty much the only video game I've played consistently. Always up for a game if time permits.
