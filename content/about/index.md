## Hi, I'm Sourya Kakarla

I'm an applied AI/ML researcher and founder building intelligent systems that enhance human lives. As Co-founder and CTO of Ladduu AI, I'm reimagining elder care through digital intelligence and robotic assistance.

With degrees from IIT Kharagpur and Columbia University, and hands-on experience at Microsoft, I've built strong expertise in Speech Recognition, NLP, and human-centered AI design. I combine academic knowledge with practical skills to create solutions that actually work for people. I thrive at the intersection of theoretical research and practical application, turning algorithms into solutions people can actually use and benefit from in their daily lives.

I'm currently wrapping up my role as Founding ML Engineer at Skylink (YC W22) in May 2025, where I've led our ML team developing AI-powered corporate travel solutions. Building agent orchestration and eval systems for a real-world AI product that actually works has been immensely satisfying. Stay tuned for our flagship customer announcement!

## Musings

### Reading
I used to hate nonfiction till I was like 20.

#### Fiction
Some of my favourite fiction works:
- ASOIAF
- HHGTG
- Stranger in a Strange land
- Catch 22
- Jeffrey Archer (guilty pleasure while growing up)
- (other cliched stuff)

#### Non-fiction

Then I went into a "seeking" phase where that's all I read for a few years.

Especially existential/spiritual/religious/mythological books to make sense of the universe/myself.

Some authors/genres/fields:
- Herman Hesse
- Richard Dawkins
- Yuval Noah Harari
- Camus
- Buddhism
  - Old Path, White Clouds
  - Two Truths
- Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism)
  - Advaita/Non-duality
  - Shaivism/Shaktism
  - Karma, Bhakti, Gnyana, Raja Yogas

Once I got the startup bug, I read a few of the typical startup books:
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things
- Zero to One
- Outliers

#### Currently Reading
Currently (April 2025), I am reading [The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity) by David Deutsch thanks to my wife who bought the book after seeing Naval Ravikant rave about it.

Jotted down some of my reads in [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/181795910-sourya-kakarla). TODO: Update it.

### Music
My music taste has seasons. Some times I listen to eastern devotional songs like:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram
- Aigiri Nandini

In other phases, I listen to western classic/soft rock:
- Pink Floyd
- Led Zeppelin

East-West fusion in content and style is probably my favourite genre. Example:
- Shiva Tandava Stotram by Shanti People

Can't sing for the life of me but write occassionally. Here's a song I wrote in Telugu - [Listen Now](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjKHg9MKsVm6f_K1Gg07jCecss4b0id7/view?usp=sharing).

### Writing

Scribbling down my thoughts into "poems" is a favourite cathartic pastime.

Holy Nature - My favorite among all my amateur work got featured in [Poets of Columbia](https://issuu.com/poetsofcolumbia/docs/poets_of_columbia_issue_one/12).

### Soccer
- Arsenal fan, 'Gooner/Gunner' for life!
- Receiving Gold Medal through MS Hall in IIT KGP General Championship is a highlight of my soccer life.
- FIFA is pretty much the only video game I ever played consistantly. Always up for a game if time permits.
